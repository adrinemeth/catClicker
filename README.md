# catClicker
app written in MVC style.

I created this app for the Udacity course "Javascript design patterns".
The design was not a priority, my main goal was to submerge in sophisticated Javascript development patterns and acquire the model-view-controller concept.
My ultimate goal is to write clean, scalable, easy-to-read code and eliminate Spaghetti code from my inventory.
I plan on adding more functionality and refining the existing ones as my time allows.

Instructions to the app
=======================

Choose a cat from the list and click it's picture as many times as you want.
You can choose an other cat and your scores will remain intact until you return to a previous cat.
You can also customize the cat's name, your score, and the picture you want to click.
